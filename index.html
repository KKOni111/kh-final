<p>The things that inspired me to become an artist were the things that I loved growing up and love to this day. I was first inspired to draw when I saw the characters on Sailor Moon, who were super pretty and colorful. I thought to myself “I would love to be able to draw characters like that someday. “ I then picked up my first sketchbook and pencil and the rest was history. Even today, I get inspiration from the games I play and the shows I watch. Some of my biggest inspirations are Kingdom Hearts, Arcane, and Into The Spiderverse, I believe that the artwork an artist makes is a reflection of who they are as a person. 
My favorite medium to work with is digital mediums. I especially like to use Procreate and an apple pencil. The reason why I like digital art the most is because of the amount of freedom it gives me. With just my iPad, a charger, and my Apple pencil, I can create artwork anywhere at any time. I also love the versatility of Procreate as an app. I have different inks, paint mediums, pattern brushes, and more at my disposal. There are also a lot of different blending modes and effects that help enhance my art. I love being able to experiment with different art styles and blending modes such as color dodge which adds a cool glow to my artwork or multiply to add nicer shadows.
	Overall, how would I describe my art style? As earlier stated, I am inspired by the media I consume. My favorite pieces of media tend to have really strong line art. I have tried to incorporate this aspect into some of my own art by using varying line weights and in some cases even using black to shade. I also love the expressiveness of the animes I watch and Kingdom Hearts. As a result, my drawings of people tend to have very big, detailed eyes with lots of shine in them. With the use of Procreate, I also like to add a lot of effects and blending styles to my art pieces. One of the things I like to do most with blending layers is add unique contrasting colors and highlights to the eyes that I draw. In my opinion, this makes the eyes of my characters pop. 
For this collection, I wanted to highlight characters of color. As a woman of color myself (black and Chinese) I always found representation in media to be important. Because of this, I wanted to honor and celebrate the characters that have brought more representation to media by drawing fan art of them.
